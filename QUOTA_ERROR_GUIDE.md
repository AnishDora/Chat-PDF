# OpenAI Quota Error Guide

## Current Issue
You're getting this error:
```
Error [InsufficientQuotaError]: 429 You exceeded your current quota
```

## What This Means
Your OpenAI API account has exceeded its usage limits. This prevents the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality from working.

## Solutions

### 1. Check Your OpenAI Billing (Recommended)
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Check your current usage and limits
- Add payment method if needed
- Upgrade your plan if necessary

### 2. Check Your API Key
Run this command to test your API key:
```bash
node check-openai-quota.js
```

### 3. Use Fallback Mode (Current Implementation)
The app now has fallback mode that:
- ✅ Allows PDF uploads to work
- ✅ Documents are stored in the database
- ⚠️ RAG functionality is limited (no AI responses based on PDF content)
- ✅ Basic chat interface still works

### 4. Alternative Solutions

#### Option A: Get a New OpenAI API Key
1. Create a new OpenAI account
2. Get free credits ($5-18 usually)
3. Update your `.env.local` with the new key

#### Option B: Use a Different AI Provider
- Anthropic Claude API
- Google Gemini API
- Local models (Ollama, etc.)

#### Option C: Wait for Quota Reset
- Free tier resets monthly
- Paid tier resets based on your billing cycle

## Current App Status
- ✅ PDF uploads work (with fallback mode)
- ✅ Database schema is correct
- ✅ Chat interface works
- ⚠️ AI responses are limited due to quota
- ✅ All other features work normally

## Testing Without OpenAI
You can still test the app by:
1. Uploading PDFs (they'll be stored)
2. Creating chats
3. Sending messages (you'll get fallback responses)
4. Testing the UI and database functionality

## Next Steps
1. Fix your OpenAI quota issue
2. The RAG functionality will automatically work once quota is restored
3. No code changes needed - the app handles this gracefully
