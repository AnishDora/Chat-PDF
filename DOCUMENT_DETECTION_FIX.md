# Document Detection Fix

## Problem
The chat was always showing "I don't have any documents to reference. Please upload some PDFs to this chat first." even when documents were uploaded.

## Root Cause
The chat API was looking for documents in the wrong place:
- **Wrong**: Looking for `chat.chat_documents` (junction table)
- **Correct**: Should look for `chat.document_ids` (array column)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Chat API Query
**Before:**
```sql
SELECT id, chat_documents (document_id) FROM chats
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT id, document_ids FROM chats
```

### 2. Updated Document ID Extraction
**Before:**
```javascript
const documentIds = chat.chat_documents?.map((cd: { document_id: string }) => cd.document_id) || [];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const documentIds = chat.document_ids || [];
```

### 3. Enhanced Fallback Messages
Updated the fallback RAG system to provide better feedback when documents are detected but API is unavailable.

## Result
✅ **Chat now correctly detects uploaded documents**
✅ **Shows proper fallback messages when documents are available**
✅ **Provides helpful guidance for API issues**

## Test the Fix
1. Upload a PDF to a chat
2. Send a message in that chat
3. You should now see a message acknowledging the documents instead of "no documents" error

## Files Modified
- `app/api/chats/[id]/messages/route.tsx` - Fixed document detection
- `lib/rag-fallback.ts` - Enhanced fallback messages
- `test-document-detection.js` - Added test script

The fix ensures that the chat properly recognizes when documents are uploaded and provides appropriate responses based on the current API status.
